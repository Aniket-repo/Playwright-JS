	Variables - A variable is a named container used to store data values in a program. It allows you to save information and use or change it   later while the program runs.

	JavaScript provides three main ways to declare variables:

	  1. var - function-scoped, can be redeclared and updated.
	  2. let - block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared.
	  3. const - block-scoped, cannot be updated or redeclared.

var x = 10;
var x = 20; // allowed


let count = 1;
count = 2;   // OK
// let count = 3; // ❌ error (same block)


const pi = 3.14;
// pi = 4; // ❌ error
